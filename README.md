[PredictionNote](http://www.prediction-note.com/) is a public prediction sharing application originally inspired by [PredictionBook](http://predictionbook.com/). It was built using:


* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) open source web application framework written in Ruby.
* A custom authentication system utilizing the [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) key derivation function to protect user credentials.
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and CSS for web page styling.
* Javascript's [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) library for sending and receiving data from the server asynchronously.
* The [sherpherd.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/shepherd) library for the tutorial.
